# k-Nearest Neighbors
This repository contains my implementation of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm performed on the thyroid dataset. It was developed as part of an assignment in the course Data Mining in 2019.
The course also involved implementing other algorithms:
- Classification and Regression Tree
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes

Which all were developed in form of collaboration and as a result can not be published. As a final project, collaboration groups had to learn how to use a data mining tool and write user documentation. In our case, my group and I worked on Orange.
